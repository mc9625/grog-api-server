This is simple rest for using groq as LLM provider.

In order to work you need to send some information

{
  "text" : " ... text message ... ",
  "auth_key": "[Your Groq API Key]",
  "option": {
              "model": "model to use - this is optional"
              }
}

This has been created expecially for the Cheshire Cat AI framework but you can use it without any problems.
